# MoreBiters
## Version 1.2.2

Adds a variety of carefully balanced biters and spitters to Factorio 1.6. Also adds a minimal amount of turrets to combat the new enemies.

Difficulty is slightly increased due to variety of biters and countermeasures needed, but combat is still fair.

## Enemy List
### Explosive Biter
Explodes on death. Explosion increases with size of biter.

### Tunneler Biter
Biter with the ability to tunnel beneath walls and shallow water. Attacks your base from within!

### Sprinter Biter
Much faster biter that will charge after the player. A real danger to vehicles and power-armor users that like to kite!

### Tank Biter
Large, slow biter with a huge amount of health and resistance. Ordinary turrets won't cut it for this brute!

### Mimic Biter
Rare and powerful biter that does not spawn normally, but it is waiting for you in the forest...

### Titan Biter
The king of all biters. Extremely rare late game boss.

### Fire Spitter
Spits a stream of fire that does heavy damage to turrets and robots, but doesn't affect walls.

### Leech Spitter
Connects to your electrical network when damaged and siphons huge amounts of power. Keep it away from your powerlines!

### Screamer Spitter
Rare spiter that summons biters in a large radius when damaged with it's call. Take it out before it's friends arrive!

## Turret List
### High-Velocity Turret
Reinforced gun turret that fires a single round at immense speed. Very effective against Tanks and Titans, but helpless against small enemies due to it's low rate of fire.

### Seismic Disruptor
Uses ultrasonic speakers to prevent biters from tunneling within it's radius.

## Options
There are options to disable some effects of biters.
